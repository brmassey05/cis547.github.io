		<h5>Course Description</h5>

		<p>This course provides a rigorous and hands-on introduction to the field of software analysis -- a
		body of powerful yet practical techniques and tools for analyzing modern software, with
		applications to systematically uncover insidious bugs, prevent security vulnerabilities, automate
		testing and debugging, and improve our confidence that software will behave as intended.</p>

		<p>Topics covered include dynamic analysis, random testing, automated test generation, dataflow
		analysis, constraint solving, type inference, and symbolic execution.  Lectures present software
		analysis concepts and algorithms in a language-independent manner, while weekly
		programming labs involve realizing them concretely in C++ using the LLVM compiler
		infrastructure.</p>

		<p>This course aims to enable you to become a better software engineer or security
		analyst by learning a rich repertoire of software analysis ideas and know-how to apply them to
		specific scenarios in practice.</p>

		<h5>Course Prerequisites</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Experience with C and systems programming (CIS 240 or CIT 595)</li>
			<li>Familiarity with data structures and algorithms (CIS 120 or CIT 594)</li>
			<li>Understanding of mathematical logic (CIS 160 or CIT 592)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Specifically:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>The assignments involve programming in C++ using the LLVM compiler infrastructure.</li>
		<li>The lectures and exams presume basic knowledge of algorithms (e.g. graph traversal and
		asymptotic analysis) and basic background in logic (e.g. set theory and boolean algebra).</li>
